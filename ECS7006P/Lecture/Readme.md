ECS7006P - Music Informatics

This module introduces students to state-of-the-art methods for the analysis of music data, with a focus on music audio. It presents in-depth studies of general approaches to the low-level analysis of audio signals, and follows these with specialised methods for the high-level analysis of music signals, including the extraction of information related to the rhythm, melody, harmony, form and instrumentation of recorded music. This is followed by an examination of the most important methods of extracting high-level musical content, sound source separation, and on analysing multimodal music data.

- Lab preparation
All labs for ECS7006 Music Informatics will be run in Python 3, using jupyter notebooks. This page provides some information towards preparing for the first lab taking place in Week 2.

If you are less familiar with Python, it is recommended that you go through the Learn Python tutorials, in particular the tutorials found in sections "Learn the Basics" and "Data Science Tutorials". It is also recommended that you go through tutorials for commonly used python packages for scientific computing:
	• NumPy tutorial
	• SciPy tutorial
	• Matplotlib tutorial
As part of the labs, you will be able to run jupyter notebooks using the following options:
	1. In the university's JupyterHub platform: https://hub.comp-teach.qmul.ac.uk . You would need to log in using your QMUL IT account and select the ECS7006 module instance.
	2. In the Google Colab environment. For this option, you will need to use either your personal google account or you can create a new google account linked to your QMUL email.
	3. Using your local python 3.x installation in your machine. For this option, please make sure that the following packages are installed:
	○ numpy 
	○ scipy 
	○ IPython 
	○ matplotlib 
	○ scikit-learn 
	○ numba 
	○ librosa 
	○ pretty_midi
